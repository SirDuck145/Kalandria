# Kalandria
Kalandria is a passion project somewhere between a MOBA like DOTA 2 and a fast paced RTS such as Starcraft.
### Creating my own art
I love using blender and wanted to get faster at making models.</br>
Not only did I want to get faster, but I wanted more experience rigging my own creations.</br>
I saw someone make a model in ten minutes and got inspired.</br>

While this model took me more than ten minutes to create...
I was happy with the final result of the model, and I had managed to rig it.
Ultimately, I will be recreating this asset... but I figured I would showcase it a little.

### Main menu
At the moment the main menu is very simplistic.</br>
It has some temp art made by Mikael Gustafsson.</br>
As for features it currently has a play button which connects the user</br>
to the network using Photon Engine's pun.</br>
It then proceeds to load the next room, which is a simple lobby</br>

### Lobby
Currently the lobby is just a waiting room for a second player to connect</br>
Once the second player is in, the next room will be loaded.</br>
However for testing purposes I created a dev button which can be pressed to load it immediately</br>

### Test Room
This is the very barest of bones for a test room</br>
It simple has the beginnings of each players base,</br>
as well as the player themself who is able to pan around the scene in classic rts style.</br>
The panning itself is highly modifiable, even allowing the player to change the margins at which the camera pans.</br>
